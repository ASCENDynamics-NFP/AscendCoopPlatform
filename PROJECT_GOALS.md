### Ascend Co-op Platform Project Goals

## Introduction

The Ascend Co-op Platform project aims to create an open-source platform that empowers communities to form, manage, and collaborate amongst their own organizations. The platform is designed to facilitate pro-labor, collaborative, and organizing features to enhance positive community impact.

## Goals

1. **Community Empowerment**: Develop a platform that enables communities to create and manage their own organizations, fostering a sense of ownership and active participation.
2. **Inter-organizational Collaboration**: Facilitate seamless collaboration between various organizations formed within the platform. This will promote synergy and collective growth amongst participating groups.
3. **Open Source**: Uphold an open-source approach to allow community contributions, ensuring the platform benefits from diverse inputs and continuous improvements.
4. **Pro-Labor and Organizing Features**: Incorporate features that promote pro-labor practices, enhance collaboration, and provide effective organizing tools. This will further amplify the platform's positive impact on the community.
5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Ensure high-quality code through comprehensive testing strategies, continuous integration, and continuous deployment processes.
6. **Community Engagement**: Encourage and manage contributions from the community through clear contribution guidelines, good documentation, and efficient communication channels such as GitHub discussions.
7. **Coding Standards**: Adhere to established coding standards, including ESLint and Prettier rules for JavaScript/TypeScript, to maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Non-Goals

The project will not focus on the following:

1. **Monetization**: As a non-profit initiative, the project will not engage in monetization strategies.
2. **Platform-Specific Development**: The project aims to be platform-agnostic, accessible from any modern web browser, and will not develop platform-specific applications (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) at the current stage.
